# ðŸ§  Image Classification Web App (CNN & Fine-Tuned Xception)

This project is a **binary image classification** web application built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed through **Streamlit**.  
It classifies images into two categories (e.g., cats vs dogs or similar) using both a **custom CNN architecture** and a **fine-tuned Xception model**.  
The app provides an interactive interface to upload an image and view the classification result instantly.
